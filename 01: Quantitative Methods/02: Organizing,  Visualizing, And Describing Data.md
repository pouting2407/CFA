# Organizing, Visualizing, And Describing Data

## Data

### Introduction
**Data:** A collection of numbers, characters, words, or text that represents a facts or information, not knowledge.

### Categorical VS Numerical
Data can be separated into 2 categories, 4 groups. Each data must belong to one of the group and no more, they are mutually exclusive.

* **Categorical (Quantitative):** Values that describe a quality of characteristic.
    - **Nominal:** No logical order.
    - **Ordinal**: Has a logicial order or rank.
* **Numerical (Qualitative):** Measured or counted quantities.
    - **Discrete:** Limited to a finite number of values. *(1,2,3)*
    - **Continuous**: Can take on any value within a range. *(1.1, 1.2, 1.3)*
    
### Cross-Sectional VS Time-Series VS Panel Data
- **Cross-Sectional:** Multiple observations of a particular variable. *(Stock prices of 60 companies)* 
- **Time Series:** Multiple observations of a particular variable for the same observation unit over time. *(GM's Stock price over the last 60 months)*
- **Panel Data:** Cross Sectional + Time-Series.

### Structured vs Unstructured Data
- **Structured:** Highly organized in a pre-defined manner. *(Stock prices, returns, EPS)*
- **Unstructured:** No organized form. *(News, Social media posts, Company filings, Audio/Video)*

In data analysis, data must be transformed into structured data for it to be useful.
