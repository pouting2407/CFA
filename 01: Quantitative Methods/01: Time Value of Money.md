# Time Value of Money

## 3 Rules of Money
1. Money now is worth more than money later.
2. More money is worth more than less money.
3. Money that you are more likely to get back is worth less than the money you are less likely to get back.

## Interest Rate
Imagine "A" wants to borrow "B" money, interest rate can be thought of in three different ways:

**Required Rate of Return:** The rate of return required by an investor. *(The cost that "A" needs to pay "B" for lending the money.)*

**Discount Rate**: The rate at which some future value is discounted to arrive at a value today *(The cost that "A" needs to pay "B" for risking on the money today will be worth less than money tomorrow.)*

**Opportunity Cost:** The value an investor or lender forgoes by choosing a particular action *(The cost that "A" needs to pay "B" for sacrificing the opportunity to use this moeny to do something else.)*

## Interest Rate Components
Interest rates may or may not include the summation of the followings:

**Real Risk Free Rate:** The real risk free rate.

**Inflation Premium:** Compensates for expected inflation.

**Default Risk Premium:** Compensate for credit risk as we are not risk free.

**Liquidity Premium:** Risk of loss vs fair value if an investment needs to be converted to cash quickly.

**Maturity Premium:** Compensates for the increased risks associated with holding an investment for a longer period.

## Single Cash Flow Calculator Keystrokes

**Future Value:** 
- Calculate the future value of $1,000 with interest rate of 5% after 40 years.
- `40` &rarr; `N` &rarr; `5` &rarr; `I/Y` &rarr; `-1000` &rarr; `PV` &rarr; `0` &rarr; `PMT` &rarr; `CPT` &rarr; `FV`

## Compounding
| Frequency   | Value |
| ----------  |:-----:|
| Annual      | 1     |
| Semi-Annual | 2     |
| Quaterly    | 4     |
| Monthly     | 12    |
| Daily       | 365   |

**Future Value**
- Calculate the future value of $10,000 with interest rate of 8% after 2 years compounded quarterly.
- `2 x 4` &rarr; `N` &rarr; `8 / 4` &rarr; `I/Y` &rarr; `-10,000` &rarr; `PV` &rarr; `0` &rarr; `PMT` &rarr; `CPT` &rarr; `FV`


- Calculate the future value of $10,000 with interest rate of 8% aftter 2 years compounded continuously
- `0.08 x 2` &rarr; `2ND` &rarr; `LN` &rarr; `x` &rarr; `10,000`
